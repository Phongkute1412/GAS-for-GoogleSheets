# [JavaScript] Google Apps Script for Google Sheets

## Introduction
Welcome to the Google Apps Script for Google Sheets repository! This repository is a collection of scripts and tutorials to enhance productivity and automate tasks in Google Sheets using Google Apps Script. For those who don't know GAS (Google App Script) is a JavaScript-based coding platform that allows you to automate tasks in many Google Workspace apps, including Gmail, Google Sheets, Google Calendar, Google Drive and Google Docs.

<b>4. COPY DATA FROM ANOTHER SHEET</b>

During the process of studying and working, I learned to use the query function to make things easier instead of using GAS, you can refer to my query function: <b>=QUERY('Sheet'!A:C, "SELECT A, B WHERE C = 'yes'", 1)</b>

<b>*Note:</b> The GAS function above is used in conjunction with Zapier to automate work, meaning that data in the Sheet sheet is only added, not edited. If you change a value from "Yes" to "No", an error will occur. The query function can solve this problem, depending on your intended use.

<b>5. AUTOMATICALLY SEND THIS GOOGLE SHEETS FILE VIA EMAIL</b>

<b>6. AUTOMATICALLY COPIES THE FORMULA WHEN ADDING A NEW LINE</b>

I don't really like spending management apps because I can't see the balance at the end of the day and customize what I want, so I created a google sheets file to manage spending. But every time I added a new line, the function was not copied and every time I had to copy it again, it was very annoying. But GAS helped me solve it.

## Motivation
My major is not information technology, but during the process of going to school and working, I realized that there are a lot of repetitive tasks but no one is looking for ways to optimize it. I share this to spread the spirit of learning and finding ways to optimize work for everyone.

## Getting Started
